Installation
============

From `pypi <https://pypi.org/project/LibRecommender/>`_ :

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install -U LibRecommender

Build from source:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install git+https://github.com/massquantity/LibRecommender.git

Or if you want to modify some source code, e.g. implementing a new algorithm by inheriting
from base classes in the library,
you can also use `editable installs <https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/userguide/development_mode.html>`_,
which allows you to modify the source code and have the changes take effect
without having to rebuild and reinstall (The ``-vv`` flag is used for outputting the build process)

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git clone https://github.com/massquantity/LibRecommender.git
    $ cd LibRecommender
    $ pip install -e . -vv

Dependencies
++++++++++++

.. HINT::

    LibRecommender contains two modules: `libreco <https://github.com/massquantity/LibRecommender/tree/master/libreco>`_
    for ``training`` and  `libserving <https://github.com/massquantity/LibRecommender/tree/master/libserving>`_
    for ``serving``. If one only wants to train a model, dependencies for `libserving` are not needed.

.. Caution::

    Since version ``1.0.0``, the following dependencies will **NOT** be installed along with LibRecommender to
    avoid messing up your local dependencies.

    Please make sure dependencies in your machine meet the version requirements.
    Or one can manually run the `requirements file <https://github.com/massquantity/LibRecommender/blob/master/requirements.txt>`_:

    .. code-block:: bash

        $ pip install -r requirements.txt

    to install all the ``libreco`` dependencies.
